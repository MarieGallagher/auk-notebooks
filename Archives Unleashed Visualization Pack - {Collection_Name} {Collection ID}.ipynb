    "If you have no previous experience of Jupyter Notebooks, the most important thing to understand is that that <Shift><Enter/Return> will run the python code inside a window and output it to the site.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The window titled `\"#RUN THIS FIRST\"` should be the first place you go. This will import all the libraries and set basic variables (eg. where your derivative files are located) for the notebook. After that, everything else should be able to run on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we cannot support code that you produced yourself. We recommend that you use `File > Make a Copy` first before changing the code in the repository. That way, you can always return to the basic visualizations we have offered here. Of course, you can also just re-download the Jupyter Notebook service from your Archives Unleashed Cloud account."
